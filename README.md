# Summary

This project is in proof-of-concept stages.
The idea is to make an OpenSCAD file that can generate a wheel with given paramters for size and compatibility with different vehicles.
So far we have the general shape of the wheel, but there is a long way to go.

# Instructions

Download or git-clone the `wheel.scad` file and run it with or open it in OpenSCAD.
Change the Paramaters at the top of the file to modify the wheel shape.

# TO-DO
  * improve shape flexibility.
  * use real screw holes for the lugnuts rather than regular holes.
  * figure out vector manipulation in OpenSCAD (lol)
  * automatically filet hard edges
  * use real units, not just arbitrary ones
