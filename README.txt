This project is in proof-of-concept stages.
The idea is to make an OpenSCAD file that can generate a wheel with given paramters for size and compatibility with different vehicles.
So far we have the general shape of the wheel, but there is a long way to go.

TO-DO
  * improve shape flexibility.
  * use real screw holes for the lugnuts rather than regular holes.
